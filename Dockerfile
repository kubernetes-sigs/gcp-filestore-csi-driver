# The netbase package is needed to get rpcbind to work correctly,
# there is a version 2 portmapper service that is not started if only
# nfs-common is installed. The older launcher.gcr.io image used here
# did not need the netbase package.
#
# If nfs is not working, the rpcinfo command is useful for
# debugging. rpcinfo -p queries using legacy version 2, and will show
# "No remote programs registered." Without netbase, rpcinfo without
# the -p options shows some services with no name, but not the key
# portmapper service.
#
# If future problems come up, looking for different files in /etc
# between older and newer distros (in this case it was /etc/rpc
# existing only in the old launcher.gcr.io image) and using dpgk -S
# <file> to determine which package supplies it, can be helpful.

# libcap2 is a dependency for nfs-common. https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/v0.15.0/images/build/debian-base/bullseye/Dockerfile.build#L44 shows that the libcap2 is hold.
# https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/v0.15.0/images/build/debian-base/bullseye/Dockerfile.build#L82 shows that the `/var/lib/apt/lists/*` is removed, that causes apt to be unaware that libcap2 is installed.
# We run `apt-get update` and then mark the package as unhold.

# Now in `nfs_services_start.sh` we call rpcbind start, this tries to source the `/lib/lsb/init-functions` file. This needs to be installed from the lsb-base package. In the debian-base image the lsb package is deleted (https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/v0.15.0/images/build/debian-base/bullseye/Dockerfile.build#L90). Hence using `apt-get install --reinstall` fixes the problem.
