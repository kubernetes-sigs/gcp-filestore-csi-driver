# A configuration file for multi-arch image building with the Google cloud build service.

# See https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/jobs/image-pushing/README.md
# for more details on image pushing process in Kubernetes.

# To promote release images, see https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/tree/main/k8s.gcr.io/images/k8s-staging-cloud-provider-gcp.

# This must be specified in seconds. If omitted, defaults to 600s (10 mins).
timeout: 1200s
# This prevents errors if you don't use both _GIT_TAG and _PULL_BASE_REF,
# or any new substitutions added in the future.
options:
  substitution_option: ALLOW_LOOSE
steps:
  # The image must contain bash and curl. Ideally it should also contain
  # the desired version of Go (currently defined in release-tools/travis.yml),
  # but that just speeds up the build and is not required.
